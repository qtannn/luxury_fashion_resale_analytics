# 🛍️ Luxury Fashion Resale Market Analysis  

## 📌 The story behind
**Top Floor Gallery (TFG)** is a fashion store in Melbourne, Australia, specializing in luxury resale items from designer brands. They approach me (or vice versa?) as they want to make more data-driven decisions for their business.   

## 🚨 The challenges?
Luxury resale is a tricky business, and TFG is struggling with:
- Unstable pricing: prices fluctuate due to seasonality & demand.
- Sourcing Inefficiency: some items are depreciated in values very fast, leading to the downturn of revenue and profit.
- Inventory Optimization: some luxury items sell out quickly, while others remain in stock for too long, affecting cash flow.

## 🎯 How I frame the task?   
- 💰 **Smarter pricing** → Identify best pricing for maximum resale value  
- 📦 **Better sourcing** → Focus on brands and items that retain value  
- 🔄 **Efficient inventory** → Reduce slow-moving stock and optimize restocking  

## 📊 **The Key Takeaways (If You’re in a Hurry, Read This!)**  

### 🔥 **What did we learn?**
✅ **Luxury Watches & Jewelry retain value better** than handbags.  
✅ **Rolex & Hermès have the highest price retention** (above 70%).  
✅ **Chanel & Louis Vuitton bags depreciate the fastest** (below 50% retention).  
✅ **Items with high demand tend to sell within 60 days**, while **others stay unsold for over 120+ days**.  
✅ **Seasonality affects pricing** – resale prices spike during peak shopping seasons.  
✅ **Some items in poor condition are still sold at 100%+ of their original price** due to rarity & demand.  


### 🏷 **Our answer to the task?**
📌 **Pricing Strategy**  
- Adjust resale prices based on **demand & seasonal trends**.  
- Use **dynamic pricing models** to maximize profit on high-value items.

- Reduce investment in **high-depreciation brands** unless they have rapid turnover.  
- Monitor **trendy items vs. classic investment pieces** to optimize sourcing decisions.  

📌 **Inventory Management**  
- Restock **fast-selling items quickly** to prevent lost sales.  
- Improve **stock rotation for slow-moving items** to avoid dead inventory.  
- Offer **promotions on aging inventory** to free up capital for new acquisitions.
